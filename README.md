Hello, I am Vernon Hughes, the OR stands for OnyxRaven. 
OnyxRaven is my handle, alias, or pseudonym I use for a lot of my projects.
At heart I am a game developer, and I have made many games. I finally got
on github so that I could collaborate with a parter.
Basically, I like documentation, coding, and other things. I have worked
for years on some projects.
I am also very much a fan of FOSS, and any advanced form of markdown, 
including markup, and asciidoc. You wouldn't know from this scant
readme though!
